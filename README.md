# sparta-ruby-loops-lab

## Main

Lab performed during class in order to test our knowledge using Ruby loops.

After each method, we had to run our code in the console, and a test was performed in order to check if the answer was correct or not.

Here's an example of how it looked like before I write the answer:

```
# return all the even numbers less than the given number
def even_numbers_less_than num
  #insert your code here
end

# return the average of all numbers in an array
def average numbers
  #insert your code here
end
```
